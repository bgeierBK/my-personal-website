            If you're reading this, chances are you know me personally, or — if I'm lucky — you ended up on my page because
            I have somehow gotten you to consider giving me a job. Either way, you may be at least aware of how my career has gone thus far.
            </p>
            <p>
            I started as a journalist in college, and I've worked in the field for nearly 15 years. I covered the 2016 presidential election, including
            being able to cover the Republican and Democratic National Conventions in person. I've interviewed major figures from Bill Ayers to Donald Trump (pre-politics)
            and I've learned just about everything there is to know about how to effectively save for retirement (at the end of the day it comes down to don't spend more than you make, contribute to your 401(k) and invest in indexed funds.)
            </p>
            <p>
            Journalism is a fickle, fickle beast, though, and if you pay attention to the news at all you know that layoffs are happening seemingly constantly,
            and I can tell you that the jobs that remain are not the kind you see in journalism movies; rather, most people making their living through words do so by 
            churning out copy without much thought, and even those jobs are precarious.
            </p>
            <p>
            Which brings me to today. I am 35-years-old and I'm forging ahead in a new career as a software developer. I'm set to begin my adventure at the Flatiron School 
            in two weeks. I am extremely excited to get started, and I hope you'll follow along on my blog as I dive into this new and hopefully less terrifying world.
